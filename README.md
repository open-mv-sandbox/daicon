Daicon is a wrapping binary format, made to build up flexible and extendible formats out of "components".

## Status

Daicon is currently a draft specification, changes will use [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).
You can use daicon in your projects, but no guarantees about cross-compatibility exist until a 1.0 release of the specification, besides an informal recommendation that 0.x minor versions stay compatible.
